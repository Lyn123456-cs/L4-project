README for Java
The main function code was given my superprovisor Debases Ganguly
The link for the GitHub is https://github.com/gdebasis/qpp-eval

And added the following file from another GitHub link: https://github.com/gdebasis/luc4ir

DocVector.java
NGramAnalyzer.java
PredRelPair.java
TrecDocIndexer.java



I mainly implemented the following file:
QPPSessionWorkFLow.java -> in order to get the QPP value for my chosen datasets
QueryResult.java -> the auxiliary class to operate the project

Modified the following file:
NQCSpecificity.java
WIGSpecificity.java

If you want to evaluate for different QPP methods, just comment another one on the QPPSessionWorkFLow.java
